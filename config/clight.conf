## Delay in seconds before clight restarts working

## This may be needed because on some laptops on resume 
## screen temp is not correctly applied, with warning in logs: "Failed to set gamma temperature."
## Clight is in fact too quick to act on resume, and it is resuming before X is fully resumed;
## thus failing to apply screen temperature.
